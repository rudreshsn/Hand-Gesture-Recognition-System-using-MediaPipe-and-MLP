# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System-using-MediaPipe-and-MLP
This project implements a real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System tailored to support physically challenged individuals, enabling them to interact with computers and devices using simple hand movements. The system is built using Python, MediaPipe, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model for gesture classification.
